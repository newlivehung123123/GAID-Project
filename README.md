# GAID-Project
The Global AI Dataset (GAID) Project is a milestone-based initiative closing existing data and research gaps: Build a web hub for professional AI safety research community, esp. those specialising in AI societal impacts (Phase 0), construct global panel AI data infrastructure to facilitate open-source research (Phases 1-2), and is ever-scaling.

# 🌍 Global AI Dataset (GAID) Project
**A Scalable Technical Framework for Global AI Governance & Bias Auditing**

## 🎯 Project Overview
The GAID Project is a milestone-based initiative designed to bridge existing data and research gaps by providing a centralized, longitudinal panel dataset (1998–2025) across 227 countries and territories.

## 🚀 Project Phases

### 📂 Phase 0: Web Application (AI in Society)
* **Output:** [aiinsocietyhub.com](https://aiinsocietyhub.com/)
* **Function:** Engineered as a non-paywalled platform for data-driven articles on AI societal impacts and a curated AI opportunities board for the professional AI safety research community.

### 📂 Phase 1: GAID Version 1
* **Output:** [Version 1 Dataset (1998–2025)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/QYLYSA)
* **Technical Milestone:** Harmonization of three major global AI databases using 123 clinical cleaning and deduplication steps to optimize data integrity by building a dataset to cover global AI data on 214 unique countries and territories across eight domains between 1998 and 2025.
* **Data Sources:** Stanford's AI Index, the Global Index on Responsible AI (GIRAI), and OECD.ai (AI Policy Observatory)

### 📂 Phase 2: GAID Version 2
* **Output:** [Version 2 Dataset (Expanded)](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/PUMGYU)
* **Technical Milestone:** Automated data ingestion, web-scraping and data curation from 11 authoritative sources, expanding the dataset to cover global panel AI data on 227 unique countries and territories across 20 domains between 1998 and 2025.
* **Data Sources:** Stanford's AI Index, the Global Index on Responsible AI (GIRAI), OECD.ai (AI Policy Observatory), MacroPolo Global AI Talent Tracker, UNESCO Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory, IEA's Energy and AI Observatory, Epoch AI, Tortoise Media - The Global AI Index, WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation) - AI Patent Landscapes, Coursera - Global Skills Report (AI & Digital Skills), World Bank - GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI)

## ⚖️ AI Governance Impact (Phases 3-4)
* **Systemic Bias Mitigation:** GAID provides the ground truth to identify "Geographical Hallucination" in foundation models.
* **Auditability:** Serving as the evidentiary foundation for the upcoming **Global AI Bias Audit (Phases 3-4)** to stress-test the reasoning fidelity of AI agents against high-scale, cross-domain evidence.
* **Open Science:** Promoting inclusion by providing high-level diagnostic tools to developers and policymakers in low-resource environments.
* **Goals:** Facilitating a collaborative ecosystem by designing and building living benchmarks on AI safety, fairness and readiness and minimising any potential risks of digital colonisation in AI-driven decision making.
