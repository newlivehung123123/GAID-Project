# Phase 0: AI in Society Web Hub
**The Centralized Interface for Global AI Governance Research**

## 🎯 Purpose
This web application was engineered to address the lack of non-paywalled, data-driven publications exclusively covering AI societal impacts.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** PHP-based architecture

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Articles Section:** Data-driven analysis on AI societal, economic and geopolitical, for example, trends.
* **Opportunities Board:** Curated AI fellowships and grants.
* **Centralized Hosting:** A single hub for all ever-scaling GAID Project milestones.
